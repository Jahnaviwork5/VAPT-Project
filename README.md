## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing Project

# Project Title: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) Project

## Project Synopsis

•	This project showcases a practical Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) activity carried out within a controlled and authorized lab setting.

•	The evaluation adheres to a well-defined approach that encompasses OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), network scanning, enumeration, and traffic analysis using commonly accepted tools in the industry.

•	The main goal of this project is to pinpoint security vulnerabilities, grasp attacker methodologies, and propose suitable strategies for mitigating risks.

## Objectives

•	Perform Footprinting and Reconnaissance using OSINT techniques

•	Conduct network scanning and service enumeration

•	Analyze network traffic and demonstrate MITM concepts

•	Understand real-world vulnerabilities and countermeasures

•	Follow ethical hacking principles and best practices

 ## Tools & Technologies
 
•	Operating Systems: Kali Linux, Windows 10

•	Reconnaissance & Scanning: Nmap, WHOIS, DNS Lookup

•	Traffic Analysis: Wireshark

•	MITM Framework: Bettercap

•	Standards Referenced: OWASP Top 10, CVSS

 ## Methodology
 
 # Phase 1: Footprinting & OSINT
 
•	Target: scanme.nmap.org (officially sanctioned test domain)

•	IP identification, DNS enumeration, WHOIS analysis

•	Google dorking for publicly available documents

•	Passive reconnaissance only

# Phase 2: Network Scanning & Enumeration

•	Target: Internal Windows host (lab environment)

•	Host discovery using Ping

•	Service and version detection using Nmap

•	OS detection and port analysis

•	ARP traffic identification using Wireshark

# Phase 3: Sniffing & Traffic Analysis

•ARP spoofing and MITM simulation using Bettercap

•	Sniffing unencrypted HTTP traffic

•	Analysis of cleartext traffic

•	Identification of secure countermeasures (HTTPS)

## Findings

•	Identified open services such as RDP (Port 3389)

•	Observed ARP requests during network scans

•	Demonstrated risks of unencrypted HTTP traffic

•	Highlighted importance of secure protocols and configurations

 ## Mitigation & Recommendations
 
•	Enforce HTTPS for all web traffic

•	Disable unused ports and services

•	Apply strong access control and authentication

•	Regular vulnerability scanning and monitoring

•	Network segmentation and secure configurations
 
## Disclaimer

•	This project was conducted strictly for educational purposes in a controlled and authorized environment.

•	Unauthorized vulnerability testing or penetration testing is illegal.
